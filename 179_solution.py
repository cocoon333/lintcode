179. Update Bits

Given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. Write a method to set all bits between i and j in N equal to M (e g , M becomes a substring of N start from i to j)
Example

Example 1:

Input: N=(10000000000)2 M=(10101)2 i=2 j=6
Output: N=(10001010100)2

Example 2:

Input: N=(10000000000)2 M=(11111)2 i=2 j=6
Output: N=(10001111100)2

Challenge

Minimum number of operations?
Clarification

You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M. That is, if M=10011ï¼Œ you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i. You would not, for example, have j=3 and i=2, because M could not fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.
Notice

In the function, the numbers N and M will given in decimal, you should also return a decimal number.
